## Key Insights

### Attrition Overview
The organization has a total workforce of 961 employees, with an attrition count of 133 and an overall attrition rate of 13.8%. The average employee age is 37 years, with an average salary of 6.3K and average tenure of 6.9 years. These metrics provide a high-level view of workforce stability and retention challenges.

### Age-Based Attrition
The highest attrition is observed among employees in the 26–35 age group. This trend indicates higher career mobility and job switching among early-career professionals.

### Salary Impact on Attrition
Attrition is significantly higher in the lower salary range, particularly among employees earning below 5K. This highlights the importance of competitive compensation and financial incentives in employee retention.

### Education Background
Employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds show relatively higher attrition. This may indicate role mismatch, career transition, or limited growth opportunities.

### Role-Based Attrition
Technical and research-oriented roles such as Laboratory Technician and Research Scientist demonstrate higher turnover compared to managerial positions. This suggests the need for focused retention strategies in specialized roles.

### Gender Trends
The analysis indicates higher attrition among male employees compared to female employees.
